This code is to extract Noiseprint feature from images:

(1) 'main_extraction_noiseprint_1.py' is the main script to extract Noiseprint feature; the values in 'res' is the final feature; you can change the code to adapt your environment.

(2) 'main_blind_localization_2.py' is used to get the heatmap of the images which can indicate the manipulated locations.

(3) The code of 'main_noiseprint_localization_merge_3.py' integrate the noiseprint feature extraction and heatmap generation.
